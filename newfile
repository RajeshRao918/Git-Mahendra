You'll need to update your branch with new commits from master, resolve those conflicts and push the updated/resolved branch to GitHub. Something like this:

git checkout master
git pull
git checkout <branch>
git merge master
[ ... resolve any conflicts ... ]
git add [files that were conflicted]
git commit
git push

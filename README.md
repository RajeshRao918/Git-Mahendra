In our example, we'll apply a filter to an equipment log worksheet to display only the laptops and projectors that are available for checkout.

In order for filtering to work correctly, your worksheet should include a header row, which is used to identify the name of each column. In our example, our worksheet is organized into different columns identified by the header cells in row 1: ID#, Type, Equipment Detail, and so on.

Challenge!

Open an existing Excel workbook. If you want, you can use our practice workbook.
Apply a filter to a column. If you are using the example, filter the Type column (column B) so it displays only laptops and cameras.
Add another filter by searching. If you are using the example, search for EDI brand equipment in the Equipment Detail column (column C).
Clear both filters.
Use an advanced text filter to view data that does not contain a certain word or phrase. If you are using the example, display data that does not contain the word saris (this should exclude all Saris brand equipment).
Use an advanced date filter to view data from a certain time period. If you are using the example, display only the equipment that was checked out in September 2013.
Use an advanced number filter to view numbers less than a certain amount. If you are using the example, display all items with an ID# below 3000.
